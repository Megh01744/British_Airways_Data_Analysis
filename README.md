# British Airways Flight Schedule Analysis

This project explores British Airways' summer flight schedule using Python. It aims to extract useful operational insights from the flight-level data, including patterns related to aircraft usage, regions, seat allocations, and passenger tiers — without using machine learning.

## Project Overview

- *Dataset:* British Airways Summer Schedule (provided by Forage)
- *Format:* Excel (.xlsx)
- *Tools Used:* Python (Jupyter Notebook), Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- *Focus:* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visual Insights

---

## Key Analyses

1. *Haul Type Distribution*
2. *Flights by Time of Day*
3. *Aircraft Usage Frequency*
4. *Monthly Flight Volume*
5. *Top Arrival Regions*
6. *Haul Distribution by Region*
7. *Business Class Seat Allocation by Country*
8. *Tier-Based Passenger Summary*
9. *Overcrowded Flights (Passenger-to-Seat Ratio)*

## Sample Insights

- Short haul flights dominate the schedule.
- Europe and the Middle East are top arrival regions.
- Some flights show high overcrowding risk based on seat availability.
- Business seat allocations vary significantly by region and country.
